# Wine Variety Prediction using Machine Learning


## About this Repository:

This was a Data Science assignment. The dataset used for this model is private, but similiar datasets can be found on Kaggle. 

## Problem Statement:

To build a predictive model using the wine dataset to predict the **variety** of the wine. 


```
For example:- Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir...etc.
```

## Solution

### Full analysis is done here : [Wine variety notebook](https://github.com/RepoMan20/wine-variety-prediction/)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Data cleaning
2. Features Selection
3. Feature encoding

## Selection of model 

Since majority of the dataset consists of categorical data, we use classification algorithms to strengthen the predictive power of the model.

Here I built two models and selected the best performing model out of the two 

1. **Decision Tree Classifier**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**

To determine the best model to use for this classification problem, a comparison was done of both the models.

According to the final results,  **Random Forest classifier** performed slightly better than the **Decision Tree Classifier** in terms of accuracy.
